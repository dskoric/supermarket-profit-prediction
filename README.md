##Supermarket profit prediction - the linear regression project

Problem description: Problem description: The CEO of a supermarket chain is considering different cities for opening a new store.

-He would like to expand the business to cities that may give higher profits.
-The chain already has stores in various cities and we have data for profits and populations from the cities.
-We also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.
--For these cities, we have the city population.

We will use the data to  identify which cities may potentially give higher profits to the business.


# Linear Regression Project

Implementation of linear regression with one variable to predict restaurant profits based on city population.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset file
- `src/`: Core implementation modules
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with analysis
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
://github.com/yourusername/supermarket-profit-prediction.git
cd supermarket-profit-prediction
2. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Analysis
### Using Jupyter Notebook
1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
# Run from command line with default parameters
python main.py

# Run with custom parameters
python main.py --alpha 0.02 --iterations 2000

# Make predictions for specific populations
python main.py --predict 3.5 7.0
